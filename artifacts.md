## Authentication System

TODO: Narrative for authentication system
### What is this? When was it created?
This artifact is the final project from IT-145 which is an authentication system that is a simple project that has a local credentials text file containing account data both with hashed passwords and raw strings. This artifact was created in August 2019 by me.

### Why did I select this item? What specific components does this artifact showcase of my skills and abilities in software development? How was it improved?
The rubric for the final project listed the various classes that contained projects that would satisfy specific categories. The IT-145 final project satisfied two of the three categories. This project was simple in its scope which makes it easy to increase its complexity while maintaining a lot of the concepts I have learned since it was created. This project showcases my skills to write clean and easy to read code as well as documentation and naming conventions.

### Did I meet the course objectives that were planned with the enhancements made to this artifact?
Yes, I believe this enhancement achieves its goal to increase the complexity of the authentication by adding role specific menu options and handling those options is protected if you arenâ€™t the role to access respective options. The options given in the role-based menu are simply placeholder to show they work but have no actual logic added to them. If I were to update further, it would be to add some options that would make sense based on the role of each user.

### Challenges and Reflection
The main challenge of performing these enhancements was to think of all the things I have learned since this project was written and trying to write those new skills and concepts into my enhancements. A lot of those concepts and skills were cemented when I created my code review earlier in this course as well as a coding standard assignment that took place in secure coding parallel to this class for this final term.
