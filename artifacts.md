## Oldschool RuneScape Guide - IronMan Game Mode

### What is this? When was it created?
This project was started in May 2017. I was an active player of Oldschool RuneScape during this time and I was playing as an Ironman which is a more difficult playstyle for the game and many guides have been written for it. I was following a guide from a person named Oziris which he wrote this guide in pastebin as raw text. I found it somewhat painful to read and follow so I decided to create a website version to make it easier to follow and easier to read. 

### Why did I select this item? What specific components does this artifact showcase of my skills and abilities in software development? How was it improved?
This item demonstrates my ability to come up with a creative solution to a problem using programming. The inital version of this website was a poor attempt, however I decided after 3-4 months of this project being live for others to use (with significant traffic) that it deserved a rewrite. I rewrote the project using CodeIgniter (which is a high level PHP framework) and developed new features and improved upon the original design to add quality of life for the user.

### Challenges and Reflection
The challenge of this project was initially my knowledge of PHP and understanding how websites operate. The hardest feature to add was saving a person's progress through the guide using checkboxes because there is about 30 pages with over 10-30 steps per page that need individual tracking. With some research and development I managed to solve this problem with around 15 lines of code or less. This project initially was just for me and was never really intended to be for others to use, but after a few weeks because I had planned on using SEO friendly URLs it blew up and now receives (at the time of this writing) 50k unique visits a month and is showing signs of growth still.

## Authentication System

### What is this? When was it created?
This artifact is the final project from IT-145 which is an authentication system that is a simple project that has a local credentials text file containing account data both with hashed passwords and raw strings. This artifact was created in August 2019 by me.

### Why did I select this item? What specific components does this artifact showcase of my skills and abilities in software development? How was it improved?
The rubric for the final project listed the various classes that contained projects that would satisfy specific categories. The IT-145 final project satisfied two of the three categories. This project was simple in its scope which makes it easy to increase its complexity while maintaining a lot of the concepts I have learned since it was created. This project showcases my skills to write clean and easy to read code as well as documentation and naming conventions.

### Did I meet the course objectives that were planned with the enhancements made to this artifact?
Yes, I believe this enhancement achieves its goal to increase the complexity of the authentication by adding role specific menu options and handling those options is protected if you arenâ€™t the role to access respective options. The options given in the role-based menu are simply placeholder to show they work but have no actual logic added to them. If I were to update further, it would be to add some options that would make sense based on the role of each user.

### Challenges and Reflection
The main challenge of performing these enhancements was to think of all the things I have learned since this project was written and trying to write those new skills and concepts into my enhancements. A lot of those concepts and skills were cemented when I created my code review earlier in this course as well as a coding standard assignment that took place in secure coding parallel to this class for this final term.

## Leaderboard Webpage

### What is this? When was it created?
This artifact is a simple leaderboard written in PHP and HTML. The leaderboard pulls data from a database to satisfy the requirement for this portion of the final project. The project was created on March 30th, 2021.

### Why did I select this item? What specific components does this artifact showcase of my skills and abilities in software development? How was it improved?
This simple artifact is designed to demonstrate my ability to create a interaction that involves a database and a programming language such as PHP in this case. This item was selected primarily because I had written something similar when I was younger. This artifact was not necessarily improved as it was written for this assignment however, it was improved from the first time I wrote this code as it now contains simple annotations to explain the code.

### Did I meet the course objectives that were planned with the enhancements made to this artifact?
This artifact should meet the course objectives by its interaction of pulling data from a database and displaying it on a web page. There are no immediate plans to make further enhancements to this artifact however, if I were to add more complexity to this artifact I would start by adding a search feature and some styling using CSS.

### Challenges and Reflection
This artifact brought me back to the first time I wrote something like this, it was a fun trip down memory lane while also providing me the opportunity to improve upon it with my experience I have gained since I wrote it the first time. The goal of writing this artifact was to create a very simple yet effective version of a leaderboard which you might see at an arcade without any styling to make it as raw as possible to create a foundation for future iterations.
